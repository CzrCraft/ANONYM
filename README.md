# Stylr
All in one platform for making custom clothing.
# API
It's API is secured with locally signed SSL Certificates. The users are securely stored in a MongoDB Database with a ssl certificate generated and password protection.
# APP
It's app is lightweight, and fast. Our only concern is to make this as straightforward as possible.

# Installation
Each program has its own installation guide, here they're just named.
# API
The api uses Node Js and MongoDB enterprise edtion.
The MongoDB installation is required to have an ssl certificate and a databse called Styler inside it. The username and password for two accounts used for testing can be found in the folder "info.txt"
# APP
The app uses flutter, so dart and flutter are required.
