# API
It's API is secured with locally signed SSL Certificates. The users are securely stored in a MongoDB Database with a ssl certificate generated and password protection.


Requirements:
  * **MongoDB Enterprise edition**
  * **Node JS**
  
Before running the api run the command "npm install" to install all the dependencies.
Api should be configured in the config.json file, and port forwarding should be allowed if you were to host the api to the public.

# APP
It's app is lightweight, and fast. Our only concern is to make this as straightforward as possible. It has a simple and clean UI.


Requirements:
 * **Dart**
 * **Flutter**
